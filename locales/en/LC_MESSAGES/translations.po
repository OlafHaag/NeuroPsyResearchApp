"# Privacy Policy\n"
"The purpose of the {appname} app is to collect anonymous research data that "
"its users, like yourself, provide to us **voluntarily** by participating in "
"the studies the {appname} app offers. Participation in these studies is "
"completely voluntary and users have a choice to share the collected research "
"data with us after each completed study. This privacy policy explains our "
"handling, use and disclosure of certain information.\n"
"\n"
"## Types of Collected Data\n"
"- Research Data\n"
"- De-identified Device Information\n"
"- Personal Data\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"### Research Data\n"
"For each study, that a user participates in, the {appname} app collects "
"research data that is relevant to the study's research question. These data "
"may include, but is not limited to, for example, the time of day the study "
"was conducted, and measures such as reaction times and scores.\n"
"\n"
"For each user account created in the app, a randomly generated character "
"string is created as part of the research data so that the data can be "
"attributed to an anonymously participating person. The name chosen for the "
"user account is not part of the research data and will not be transmitted "
"when uploading the data.  \n"
"The collected research data will not reveal the identity of the "
"participating user.\n"
"\n"
"It is the responsibility of the participants to protect their user account "
"and the device against unauthorized access.\n"
"\n"
"### De-identified Device Information\n"
"To associate research data that was recorded on the same device, a character "
"string is transmitted, which does not allow personal identification of the "
"device or its users. We also collect device information such as the screen "
"resolution and which type of operating system the {appname} app is running "
"on. These data are considered part of the research data.\n"
"\n"
"### Personal Data\n"
"The {appname} app collects voluntary information about the age group and "
"gender of the participants. The {appname} app does **not** collect sensitive "
"or personally identifiable information such as a user's name, address, "
"telephone number, passwords, payment details, or social security number. "
"Therefore, the information cannot be used to identify a natural person and "
"is thus not considered personal data (Recital 26 GDPR).  \n"
"However, if a user decides to contact us via e-mail, which is completely "
"optional, we and the third-parties providing the e-mail services will "
"process the e-mail address and its content to provide the service. After "
"receiving an e-mail by a user, any research data that was sent with it will "
"be extracted and therefore separated from any personally identifiable "
"information the user may have provided to us within the e-mail. This way the "
"research data can not be used to reveal the identity of the user. The e-mail "
"will be deleted alongside any personal information that was provided to us "
"within 10 days of receiving the e-mail. We will not share any e-mail address "
"or any personal information of users with other third parties.\n"
"\n"
"## Local Storage of Research Data\n"
"Users can opt-in to store the collected information locally on the device by "
"enabling the option in the settings of the {appname} app. Any locally stored "
"research data from a user account will be removed when the user account is "
"removed from the {appname} app.  \n"
"All locally stored research data by the {appname} app is removed when the "
"app is removed from the device.\n"
"\n"
"## Sharing of Research Data\n"
"When a user decides to share the collected research data with us, the data "
"will be transferred to a database on servers within the European Union which "
"are provided by a third party. You can find out more about the data "
"protection measures of the third-party provider at the following Internet "
"address:\n"
"\n"
"<https://www.heroku.com/policy/security#data-security>\n"
"\n"
"After transfer of the research data to the database, complete deletion of "
"the research data collected can no longer be guaranteed, since we can not "
"attribute the anonymous data to a specific person. Furthermore, backup "
"copies of the data are created within the infrastructure of the third-party "
"provider. Moreover, immediate public access to the research data and its "
"results from automated processing is possible, see **Usage of Anonymized "
"Data**.\n"
"\n"
"## Usage of Anonymized Data\n"
"The results and collected research data from any study in the {appname} app "
"will be published as a scientific publication. This is done in anonymized "
"form, i.e. without the research data on its own being able to identify a "
"specific person. The voluntary information about age group and gender of "
"participants are used to assess the representativeness of the research data. "
"The fully anonymized data from these studies are made available on the "
"Internet as open data under the [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons."
"org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). This means that the research data can also be used "
"for any purposes other than the studies they were originally collected for, "
"including commercial purposes.\n"
"\n"
"The collected research data will be processed to perform statistical "
"analysis for scientific inquiries in a semi-automatic fashion. A link to the "
"web-interface for analyzing the research data is provided within the "
"{appname} app.\n"
"\n"
"After completing a study, the data will possibly be stored and published in "
"a national or international data archive. These studies will thus follow the "
"recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German "
"Society for Psychology (DGPs) for quality assurance in research.\n"

"[b]Explanation of the study:[/b]\n"
"We are very pleased that you are interested in participating in our study. "
"The neuromotor system of our human bodies has more elements (such as joints, "
"digits, and muscles) than are needed for accomplishing most typical tasks. "
"For example, when pointing your finger at a position, there's still room for "
"your elbow and shoulder to move. You could also reach that same position "
"with either weak or strong muscle force. The goal of this study is to "
"investigate how the accuracy of performing a motion task changes when the "
"range of motion for solving the task gets limited by an additional "
"concurrent task. Such information could be beneficial for athlete training "
"or rehabilitation. The respective tasks are described and explained to you "
"in detail beforehand. No particular stress or even risks are to be expected "
"when performing the tasks."

"giving reasons, without incurring any disadvantages. To do so just press the "
"back button during the study or close the app.After completing all the tasks "
"you are offered to upload the collected research data to the Internet. You "
"can therefore withdraw your consent to the online storage and processing of "
"the data until the end of task completion. If you cancel your participation "

"{author}, including the software of the Service downloaded on Your personal "
"device.  \n"
"\"We\", \"Us\" and \"Our\" refer to the official web-site of the Service and "
"the software of the Service, as well as the authors.  \n"
"\"Service\" means the software {appname}.\n"
"\n"
"## Acceptance of Terms of Use\n"
"By downloading or using the app, these Terms as well as our privacy policy "
"and all applicable laws will automatically apply to you - you should make "
"sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.  \n"
"You must be 13 years of age or older and the minimum age of digital consent "
"in your country to use this Service. If you are the age of majority in your "
"jurisdiction or over, you consent that you have read, understood, and accept "
"to be bound by the Terms, and if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of "
"digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority in your "
"jurisdiction, you confirm that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees "
"to these Terms. If you do not agree to these terms and all applicable "
"additional terms, then you have no right to access or use any of the "
"Service.\n"
"\n"
"## Disclaimers and Warranties\n"
"You are granted a nonexclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to perform, "
"display, and use the Product on the Device.  \n"
"{author} built the {appname} app as an Open Source app. This Service is "
"provided by {author} at no cost and is intended for use as is.  \n"
"The {appname} app stores and processes de-identified data that you have "
"provided to us, in order to provide the Service. As it is with internet "
"based services, a 100% anonymity cannot be guaranteed. It's your "
"responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore "
"recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process "
"of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official "
"operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to "
"malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security "
"features and it could mean that the {appname} app won't work properly or at "
"all.\n"
"\n"
"You should be aware that there are certain things that {author} will not "
"take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app "
"to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or "
"provided by your mobile network provider, but {author} cannot take "
"responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don't "
"have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.\n"
"\n"
"If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember "
"that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will "
"still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the "
"cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or "
"other third party charges. In using the app, you're accepting responsibility "
"for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app "
"outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off "
"data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're "
"using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received "
"permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n"
"\n"
"Along the same lines, {author} cannot always take responsibility for the way "
"you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged - "
"if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the Service, "
"{author} cannot accept responsibility.\n"
"\n"
"With respect to {author}'s responsibility for your use of the app, when "
"you're using the app, it's important to bear in mind that although we "
"endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely "
"on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it "
"available to you. {author} accepts no liability for any loss, direct or "
"indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality "
"of the app.\n"
"\n"
"## Links to Other Sites\n"
"This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party "
"link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites may "
"not be operated by {author}. Therefore, {author} strongly advises you to "
"review the Privacy Policy of these websites. {author} has no control over "
"and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices "
"of any third-party sites or services.\n"

"possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app. "
"The app is currently available on Android - the requirements for system (and "
"for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app "
"to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep "
"using the app. If you do not accept updates to the application, your right "
"to use and access the Services will immediately cease. {author} does not "
"promise that the app will always be updated so that it is relevant to you "
"and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your "
