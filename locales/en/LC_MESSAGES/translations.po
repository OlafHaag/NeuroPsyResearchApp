"# Privacy Policy\n"
"The purpose of the {appname} app is to collect anonymous research data that "
"its users, like yourself, provide to us **voluntarily** by participating in "
"the studies the {appname} app offers. Participation in these studies is "
"completely voluntary and users have a choice to share the collected research "
"data with us after each completed study.\n"
"\n"
"## Types of Collected Data\n"
"- Research Data\n"
"- De-identified Device Information\n"
"- Personal Data\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"### Research Data\n"
"For each study, that a user participates in, the {appname} app collects "
"research data that is relevant to the study's research question. These data "
"may include, but is not limited to, for example, the time of day the study "
"was conducted, and psychometric measures such as reaction times and scores.\n"
"\n"
"For each user account created in the app, a randomly generated character "
"string is created as part of the research data so that the data can be "
"attributed to an anonymously participating person. The name chosen for the "
"user account is not part of the research data and will not be transmitted "
"when uploading the data.  \n"
"The collected research data will not reveal the identity of the "
"participating user.\n"
"\n"
"It is the responsibility of the participants to protect their user account "
"and the device against unauthorized access.\n"
"\n"
"### De-identified Device Information\n"
"To associate research data that was recorded on the same device, a character "
"string is transmitted, which does not allow personal identification of the "
"device or its users. We also collect device information such as the screen "
"resolution and which type of operating system the {appname} app is running "
"on. These data are considered part of the research data.\n"
"\n"
"### Personal Data\n"
"The {appname} app does **not** collect sensitive or personally identifiable "
"information such as a user's name, address, telephone number, IP-address, "
"passwords, payment details, or social security number.  \n"
"However, if a user decides to contact us via e-mail, which is completely "
"optional, we and the third-parties providing the e-mail services will "
"process the e-mail address and its content to provide the service. After "
"receiving an e-mail by a user, any research data that was sent with it will "
"be extracted and therefore separated from any personally identifiable "
"information the user may have provided to us within the e-mail. This way the "
"research data can not be used to reveal the identity of the user. The e-mail "
"will be deleted alongside any personal information that was provided to us "
"within 10 days of receiving the e-mail. We will not share any e-mail address "
"or any personal information of users with other third parties.\n"
"\n"
"## Local Storage of Research Data\n"
"Users can opt-in to store the collected information locally on the device by "
"enabling the option in the settings of the {appname} app. Any locally stored "
"research data from a user account will be removed when the user account is "
"removed from the {appname} app.  \n"
"All locally stored research data by the {appname} app is removed when the "
"app is removed from the device.\n"
"\n"
"## Sharing of Research Data\n"
"When a user decides to share the collected research data with us, the data "
"will be transferred to a database on servers within the European Union which "
"are provided by a third party. You can find out more about the data "
"protection measures of the third-party provider at the following Internet "
"address:\n"
"\n"
"<https://www.heroku.com/policy/security#data-security>\n"
"\n"
"After transfer of the research data to the database, complete deletion of "
"the research data collected can no longer be guaranteed, since we can not "
"attribute the anonymous data to a specific person. Furthermore, backup "
"copies of the data are created within the infrastructure of the third-party "
"provider. Moreover, immediate public access to the research data and its "
"results from automated processing is possible, see **Usage of Anonymized "
"Data**.\n"
"\n"
"## Usage of Anonymized Data\n"
"The results and collected research data from any study in the {appname} app "
"will be published as a scientific publication. This is done in anonymized "
"form, i.e. without the research data on its own being able to identify a "
"specific person. The fully anonymized data from these studies are made "
"available on the Internet as open data under the [CC-BY-SA license](https://"
"creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). This means that the research data "
"can also be used for any purposes other than the studies they were "
"originally collected for, including commercial purposes.\n"
"\n"
"The collected research data will be processed to perform statistical "
"analysis for scientific inquiries in a semi-automatic fashion. A link to the "
"web-interface for analyzing the research data is provided within the "
"{appname} app.\n"
"\n"
"After completing a study, the data will possibly be stored and published in "
"a national or international data archive. These studies will thus follow the "
"recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German "
"Society for Psychology (DGPs) for quality assurance in research.\n"

"giving reasons, without incurring any disadvantages. To do so just press the "
"back button during the study or close the app.After completing all the tasks "

"can therefore withdraw your consent to the online storage and processing of "
